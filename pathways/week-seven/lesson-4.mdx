Congrats on reaching this section! You've learned about smart contracts, UI with Nextjs and Tailwind, testing, a contract verification in the past three lessons.
In this lesson, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to Connect UI to Smart Contract & Setup Defender
Admin, Replay & Autotask. This will help you better understand the process.

### Prerequisites

- [Create](https://thegraph.com/en/) an account on the subgraph
- Click on sign in with GitHub
- Install the graph globally on your local machine using npm. In your terminal run

### Step 1

To begin, paste the following code in your index.tx file

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import PaymentCard from "../components/PaymentCard";
import {
  abi as psAbi,
  address as psAddress,
} from "@ebook-payment-subscription-platform/hardhat/deployments/alfajores/PaymentSubscription.json";
import { useCelo } from "@celo/react-celo";
import { parseEther } from "ethers/lib/utils.js";

const plans = {
  0: { name: "Basic", price: 2 },
  1: { name: "Premium", price: 5 },
  2: { name: "Enterprise", price: 12 },
};

export default function Home() {
  const subscriptionToken = "0xEb3345B25d59Ad1dD153DAf883b377258E8515F9";
  const [activePlan, setActivePlan] = useState(null);
  const { kit, address } = useCelo();
  const paymentSubscriptionContract = new kit.connection.web3.eth.Contract(
    psAbi,
    psAddress
  );
  const cUsdContract = new kit.connection.web3.eth.Contract(
    [
      {
        inputs: [
          {
            internalType: "address",
            name: "spender",
            type: "address",
          },
          {
            internalType: "uint256",
            name: "amount",
            type: "uint256",
          },
        ],
        name: "approve",
        outputs: [
          {
            internalType: "bool",
            name: "",
            type: "bool",
          },
        ],
        stateMutability: "nonpayable",
        type: "function",
      },
    ],
    subscriptionToken
  );

  const subscribeToPlan = async (plan) => {
    try {
      const tx = await cUsdContract.methods
        .approve(
          psAddress,
          parseEther((plans[plan].price * 12).toString()).toHexString()
        )
        .send({ from: address });

      if (tx.status) {
        const tx = await paymentSubscriptionContract.methods
          .subscribe(plan, 12)
          .send({ from: address });

        if (tx.status) {
          setActivePlan(plan);
        }
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const getActivePlan = async () => {
      const plan = await paymentSubscriptionContract.methods
        .subscriptions(address)
        .call();

      if (plan.endDate !== "0") {
        setActivePlan(parseInt(plan.plan));
      }
    };

    getActivePlan();
  }, [address]);

  return (
    <div className="space-y-8 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-3 sm:gap-6 xl:gap-10 lg:space-y-0">
      <div className="flex">
        <PaymentCard
          planName={"Basic"}
          active={activePlan == 0}
          price={2}
          onClick={() => subscribeToPlan(0)}
        />
      </div>
      <div className="flex">
        <PaymentCard
          planName={"Premium"}
          active={activePlan == 1}
          price={5}
          onClick={() => subscribeToPlan(1)}
        />
      </div>
      <div className="flex">
        <PaymentCard
          planName={"Enterprise"}
          active={activePlan == 2}
          price={12}
          onClick={() => subscribeToPlan(2)}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Import the mock cUSD token we created with its contract address

To test the UI , in your terminal run

```bash
yarn run dev

```

and click on subscribe, your metamask should pop up and you should see the output below

Sign the transaction and once succesfully executed, the subscribe button should change to unsubscribe.

Verify your contract on celoscan and you should see your transaction.

### Step 2

Head over to openzepplin, click on defender and sign up. Then click on add a contract

- name : EbookSPP
- network : celo alfajores
- address : "your contract address"

NOTE: it might throw an error saying "unable to fetch abi" , copy and paste the contract abi and click on create

### Step 3

Next we create a relay. A relay is like a private key that helps in creating a wallet that can be used like a
relayer to interact with the smart contract. You can read more on relayer
[here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/relay).

To create a relayer follow these steps below:

- click on relayer on the side bar
- name : Ebook Relayer SPP
- network : Celo alfajores

then click on create.
send some celo to your relayer from your wallet.

### Step 4

Transfer the ownership of the contract to the relayer, i will strongly advice that you watch the video tutorial
link that would be attached at the end of the article from this step because it is easier to graps and understand.

Thank you for making it through from the first part to the final part.
