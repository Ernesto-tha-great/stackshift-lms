Congratulations on making it to this section! You've already read about smart contracts and UI using Nextjs and
Tailwind in the first part of our tutorial. Now, we'll delve deeper into writing and verifying the smart contract
by providing step-by-step instructions in this article.

## Prerequisites

To proceed, it's required that you finish the UI and smart contract
[tutorial](https://hashnode.com/preview/631cd986f73f4734bc05524d), along with the associated unit tests.
Further information on unit tests can be found [here.](https://www.guru99.com/unit-testing-guide.html)

### Step 1

Navigate into your test folder and create a new file called `subscription-test.js`

Head over to [Hardhat Network Helper](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers/docs/overview) which gives you
the ability to mine blocks up to a certain timestamp or block number. To install paste the below command into
your terminal.

```bash
yarn add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers
```

Once the initial task is completed, we must organize our test cases in a way that simplifies identifying what
needs to be tested and the expected results. Below are the test cases we will use for this project:

- Do we have three plans?
- Is the first plan what we expect?
- Is the third plan what we expect?
- Is the second plan what we expect?
- Can we subscribe to the right plan?
- Can we subscribe to the wrong plan?
- Can we subscribe to the same plan twice?
- Can a user subscribe to a plan without enough allowance?
- Can a user be charged 11 more times after the first charge?
- Can a user subscribe to a plan without enough balance for the first charge?

To run the first step add the following code to your subscription-test.js file

```javascript
const { expect, assert } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const helpers = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers");

const oneHour = 60 * 60 * 1;

before(async function () {
  const [deployer, accountA, accountB, accountC] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const MockCUSD = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockCUSD");
  const cUSD = await MockCUSD.deploy();
await cUSD.deployed();

  const PaymentSubscription = await ethers.getContractFactory(
    "PaymentSubscription"
  );
  const paymentSubscription = await PaymentSubscription.deploy(cUSD.address);

  await paymentSubscription.deployed();

  this.paymentSubscription = paymentSubscription;
  this.cUSD = cUSD;
  this.deployer = deployer;
  this.accountA = accountA;
  this.accountB = accountB;
  this.accountC = accountC;
});

describe("PaymentSubscription", function () {
  it("Should have Basic plan", async function () {
    const basicPlan = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);
    expect(basicPlan.price).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("2"));
    expect(basicPlan.duration).to.equal(oneHour);
  });
```

In your terminal, run this command:

```bash
 npx hardhat test test/subscription-test.js --network hardhat
```

You should see the following result in your terminal

Also, we need to try this for our premium plan and enterprise plan. In that same file add the following code

```javascript
it("Should have Premium plan", async function () {
  const premiumPlan = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(1);
  expect(premiumPlan.price).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("5"));
  expect(premiumPlan.duration).to.equal(oneHour);
});

it("Should have Enterprise plan", async function () {
  const enterprisePlan = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(2);
  expect(enterprisePlan.price).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("12"));
  expect(enterprisePlan.duration).to.equal(oneHour);
});
```

and run the same command in your terminal. Your terminal should look like this if properly executed.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678052443621/382c4bdc-925d-4d13-86c6-f182ef9dec59.png)

### Step 2

Also, we want a user to be able to subscribe to a 12-month plan. To do this, we need to add the following code
after the enterprise plan function

```javascript
it("Should allow user to subscribe to a 12 months plan", async function () {
    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);
await this.cUSD.approve(
      this.paymentSubscription.address,
      basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
    );
await this.paymentSubscription.subscribe(basic.plan, 12);
    const subscription = await this.paymentSubscription.subscriptions(
      this.deployer.address
    );
```

Your final code should look like this.

```javascript
 const { expect, assert } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const helpers = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers");

const oneHour = 60 * 60 * 1;

before(async function () {
  const [deployer, accountA, accountB, accountC] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const MockCUSD = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockCUSD");
  const cUSD = await MockCUSD.deploy();
await cUSD.deployed();

  const PaymentSubscription = await ethers.getContractFactory(
    "PaymentSubscription"
  );
  const paymentSubscription = await PaymentSubscription.deploy(cUSD.address);

  await paymentSubscription.deployed();

  this.paymentSubscription = paymentSubscription;
  this.cUSD = cUSD;
  this.deployer = deployer;
  this.accountA = accountA;
  this.accountB = accountB;
  this.accountC = accountC;
});

describe("PaymentSubscription", function () {
  it("Should have Basic plan", async function () {
    const basicPlan = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);
    expect(basicPlan.price).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("2"));
    expect(basicPlan.duration).to.equal(oneHour);
  });

it("Should allow user to subscribe to a 12 months plan", async function () {
    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);
await this.cUSD.approve(
      this.paymentSubscription.address,
      basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
    );
await this.paymentSubscription.subscribe(basic.plan, 12);
const subscription = await this.paymentSubscription.subscriptions(
      this.deployer.address
    );
```

Run the same command in your terminal, and your terminal should give you the following output below:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678053462266/6df5b636-2b8c-4b90-b1c9-f95de8629095.png)

However, we need to confirm that the time a user subscribes is the actual current block time and that a user can
subscribe to the wrong plan or the same plan twice. Paste the following code after the last function.

```javascript
const currentTime = (await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest")).timestamp;

    expect(subscription.plan).to.equal(basic.plan);
    expect(subscription.startDate).to.equal(ethers.BigNumber.from(currentTime));
    expect(subscription.endDate).to.equal(
      ethers.BigNumber.from(currentTime + 12 * oneHour)
    );
    expect(subscription.nextCharge).to.equal(
      ethers.BigNumber.from(currentTime + oneHour)
    );
  });

it("Should not allow user to subscribe to the wrong plan", async function () {
    await expect(this.paymentSubscription.subscribe(3, 12)).to.be.rejectedWith(
      Error
    );
  });

  it("Should not allow user to subscribe to the same plan twice", async function () {
    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);

    await this.cUSD.approve(
      this.paymentSubscription.address,
      basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
    );

    expect(
      this.paymentSubscription.subscribe(basic.plan, 12)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("Already subscribed");
  });
```

Run the same command in your terminal, and you should get the following results if executed correctly:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678058189074/27729e83-121f-489e-b256-9eeedf8541f8.png)

### Step 3

Finally, we would also test to see if a user could subscribe to a plan without enough allowance, be charged 11
more times after the first charge, and subscribe to a plan without enough balance for the first charge. Add the
following code after your last test

```javascript
it("Should not allow user to subscribe to a plan without enough allowance", async function () {
    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);

    await expect(
      this.paymentSubscription.connect(this.accountA).subscribe(basic.plan, 12)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("Insufficient allowance");
  });

  it("Should not allow user to subscribe to a plan without enough balance for the first charge", async function () {
    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);

    await this.cUSD
      .connect(this.accountA)
      .approve(
        this.paymentSubscription.address,
        basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
      );

    await expect(
      this.paymentSubscription.connect(this.accountA).subscribe(basic.plan, 12)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("Insufficient balance");
  });

  it("Should allow user to be charged 11 more times after the first charge", async function () {
    await this.cUSD.mint(this.accountC.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("24"));

    const basic = await this.paymentSubscription.plans(0);

    await this.cUSD
      .connect(this.accountC)
      .approve(
        this.paymentSubscription.address,
        basic.price.mul(ethers.BigNumber.from(12))
      );

    await this.paymentSubscription
      .connect(this.accountC)
      .subscribe(basic.plan, 12);

    for (let monthsCharged = 2; monthsCharged <= 12; monthsCharged++) {
      const currentBal = await this.cUSD.balanceOf(this.accountC.address);
      const subscription = await this.paymentSubscription.subscriptions(
        this.accountC.address
      );

      await helpers.time.increase(oneHour);

      console.table({
        monthsCharged,
        currentBal: ethers.utils.formatEther(currentBal),
        nextCharge: ethers.utils.formatEther(subscription.nextCharge),
      });

      await this.paymentSubscription
        .connect(this.deployer)
        .charge(this.accountC.address);
    }

    expect(await this.cUSD.balanceOf(this.accountC.address)).to.equal(0);

    const subscription = await this.paymentSubscription.subscriptions(
      this.accountC.address
    );
    const active = await this.paymentSubscription.activeSubscriptions(
      this.accountC.address
    );

    expect(subscription.nextCharge).to.equal(0);
    expect(active).to.equal(false);
  });
});
```

Run the same command in your terminal, and you should get the following results if executed correctly:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678096813584/c2a4dba3-8f44-45b6-b233-503fdd696089.png)

Awesome! We now have all our tests working, and the next thing we need to do is verify our contract and run a
test coverage. To do this head over to [solidity coverage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solidity-coverage) and
run the command below in your terminal

```bash
yarn add solidity-coverage --dev
```

**Require** the plugin in `hardhat.config.js` by pasting this code

```javascript
require("solidity-coverage");
```

In your terminal run,

```bash
npx hardhat coverage --testfiles "test/registry/*.ts" --network hardhat
```

To verify your contract,

- Head over to [Celoscan](https://celoscan.io/)
- Login or Signup
- Click on the API-KEYs menu on the sidebar and generate a key
- Paste the key in the space available for it in the `.env` file

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678100705430/1a47fdab-dad4-47a3-a4ae-826dbf4211e9.png)

In your terminal run

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network alfajores
```

To deploy, open up `deploy.js` file in the deploy folder and paste the following code inside

```javascript
module.exports = async ({ getNamedAccounts, deployments }) => {
  const { deploy } = deployments;
  const { deployer } = await getNamedAccounts();

  const cUSD = await deploy("MockCUSD", {
    from: deployer,
    log: true,
  });

  console.log("cUSD deployed to:", cUSD.address);

  await deploy("PaymentSubscription", {
    from: deployer,
    args: [cUSD.address],
    log: true,
  });
};

module.exports.tags = ["MockCUSD"];
```

In your terminal, run

```bash
yarn run deploy
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678104236910/f4ebeb47-47e5-48ff-83ee-6bf08aabcc74.png)

And to verify our contracts we need to use the format below.

```bash
npx hardhat verify <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS> --network alfajores
```

To verify our subscription payment smart contract that was deployed above, the command to run will be:

```bash
npx hardhat hardhat verify 0x95BD5b1B16C586025bF0750c21bd1de433de8D4c 0xEb3345B25d59Ad1dD153DAf883b377258E8515F9 --network alfajores
```
