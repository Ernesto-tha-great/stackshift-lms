Congrats on reaching this section! You've learned about smart contracts, UI with Nextjs and Tailwind, testing, and contract verification in the past two tutorials.
In this lesson, we will provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a subgraph that queries subscription
details from the OpenZeplin Defender autotask script. This will help you better understand the process.

### Prerequisites

- [Create](https://thegraph.com/en/) an account on the subgraph
- Click on sign in with GitHub
- Install the graph globally on your local machine using npm. In your terminal run

In the project folder run:

```bash
yarn subgraphs:get-abi
```

### Step 1

To initialize the graph in our project, cd into the subgraph package folder and run

```bash
graph init
```

Choose Ethereum for protocol, and hosted services, and add your GitHub username as your subgraph name.

Add celo-alfajores as the network, and you should see the output below if executed successfully.

In our subgraph, a new folder called `ebook-payment-subscription-platform` has been created or in your own case
whatever you named your folder name, Inside the folder, open the `schema.graphql` file and paste the following
code inside.

```graphql
type Plan @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: Bytes!
  plan: Int!
  price: BigInt!
  duration: BigInt!
  subscriptions: [SubscriptionP!]! @derivedFrom(field: "plan")
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  blockTimestamp: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}

type SubscriptionP @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: Bytes!
  subscriber: Bytes! # address
  plan: Plan!
  nextCharge: BigInt!
  endDate: BigInt!
  blockNumber: BigInt!
  blockTimestamp: BigInt!
  transactionHash: Bytes!
}
```

Then in your subgraph.yaml file delete the default code and paste the following code

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.5
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum
    name: PaymentSubscription
    network: celo-alfajores
    source:
      address: "0x95BD5b1B16C586025bF0750c21bd1de433de8D4c"
      abi: PaymentSubscription
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.7
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      entities:
        - Plan
        - SubscriptionP
      abis:
        - name: PaymentSubscription
          file: ./abis/PaymentSubscription.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: PlanCreated(uint8,uint256,uint256)
          handler: handlePlanCreated
        - event: SubscriptionCancelled(indexed address)
          handler: handleSubscriptionCancelled
        - event: SubscriptionCharged(indexed address,uint8,uint256)
          handler: handleSubscriptionCharged
        - event: SubscriptionCreated(indexed address,uint8)
          handler: handleSubscriptionCreated
      file: ./src/payment-subscription.ts
```

In your terminal run

```bash
graph codegen
```

You should see the following output

Lets proceed to doing dome cleanups in our file , navigate to the src folder and open `paymentsubscription.ts`
file, delete the default code and paste the following

```typescript
import { BigInt, Bytes } from "@graphprotocol/graph-ts";
import {
  PlanCreated as PlanCreatedEvent,
  SubscriptionCancelled as SubscriptionCancelledEvent,
  SubscriptionCharged as SubscriptionChargedEvent,
  SubscriptionCreated as SubscriptionCreatedEvent,
  PaymentSubscription as PaymentSubscriptionContract,
  PaymentSubscription__subscriptionsResult,
} from "../generated/PaymentSubscription/PaymentSubscription";
import { Plan, SubscriptionP as Subscription } from "../generated/schema";

export function handlePlanCreated(event: PlanCreatedEvent): void {
  let entity = new Plan(
    event.transaction.hash.concatI32(event.logIndex.toI32())
  );

  entity.plan = event.params.plan;
  entity.price = event.params.price;
  entity.duration = event.params.duration;

  entity.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  entity.blockTimestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  entity.transactionHash = event.transaction.hash;

  entity.save();
}

export function handleSubscriptionCancelled(
  event: SubscriptionCancelledEvent
): void {
  let entity = Subscription.load(event.params.subscriber);

  if (entity == null) {
    return;
  }

  entity.nextCharge = BigInt.fromI32(0);
  entity.endDate = BigInt.fromI32(0);

  entity.save();
}

export function handleSubscriptionCharged(
  event: SubscriptionChargedEvent
): void {
  let entity = Subscription.load(event.params.subscriber);

  if (entity == null) {
    entity = new Subscription(event.params.subscriber);

    let paymentSubscriptionContract = PaymentSubscriptionContract.bind(
      event.address
    );
    let subscription = paymentSubscriptionContract.subscriptions(
      event.params.subscriber
    );

    entity.plan = Bytes.fromI32(subscription.getPlan());
    entity.subscriber = event.params.subscriber;
    entity.endDate = subscription.getEndDate();
  }

  entity.nextCharge = event.params.nextCharge;

  entity.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  entity.blockTimestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  entity.transactionHash = event.transaction.hash;

  entity.save();
}

export function handleSubscriptionCreated(
  event: SubscriptionCreatedEvent
): void {
  let entity = new Subscription(event.params.subscriber);

  entity.subscriber = event.params.subscriber;

  let paymentSubscriptionContract = PaymentSubscriptionContract.bind(
    event.address
  );
  let subscription = paymentSubscriptionContract.subscriptions(
    event.params.subscriber
  );

  entity.plan = Bytes.fromI32(subscription.getPlan());
  entity.endDate = subscription.getEndDate();
  entity.nextCharge = subscription.getNextCharge();

  entity.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  entity.blockTimestamp = event.block.timestamp;
  entity.transactionHash = event.transaction.hash;

  entity.save();
}
```

### Step 2

The next action is to upload our subgraph, Head over to your dashboard and create a subgraph.

in your terminal run

```bash
graph auth --product hosted-service<the number generated for you>
graph deploy --product hosted-service<yourname-subgraphname>
```

You have successfully setup subgraph to query subscription details from openzepplin defender
