### What is ContractKit?​

[ContractKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit) is a library to help you interact with the Celo blockchain and allows you to integrate Celo smart
contracts into your applications easily.

![celo](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*fQWkzpN9-E-aybdq2HnZNw.png)

Here are a few things you can do with ContractKit:

- Connect to a Celo node
- Interact with Celo Core contracts
- Send transactions on Celo
- …and more!
  In this lesson, we’ll focus on the GoldToken.sol contract, but you can use ContractKit to interact with any of
  the Celo Core Contracts.

### react-celo

To extend ContractKit, Celo also built [react-celo](https://github.com/celo-org/react-celo) to make it easy to access all of the ContractKit
features within your React applications.

---

### Step 2: Imports, variables, & connections

This project contains a JavaScript file named contractkit.js that includes all project code. The first step
to using ContractKit in this file is importing dependencies and setting up the project variables.

### Import Web3

[Web3](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js/blob/1.x/README.md) is an Ethereum [JavaScript API](http://web3js.readthedocs.io/) that allows you to connect to the Ethereum blockchain. Since Celo is
fully EVM compatible, you can also use this to connect to the Celo blockchain as const Web3.

```javascript
const Web3 = require("web3");
```

### Define web3

Using Web3 allows you to connect to a Celo node by providing the node’s endpoint. In this case,
you’re connected to a remote Celo Test Network ( [Alfajores](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet))
using a hosted node service named [Forno](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/forno).

```javascript
const web3 = new Web3(`https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org`);
```

### ContractKit

Next, requiring @celo/contractkit will allow you to access ContractKit and interact with the Celo blockchain
from your JavaScript file.

```javascript
const ContractKit = require("@celo/contractkit");
```

### kit

Finally, to start working with ContractKit, you’ll need a kit instance. The following line passes the network
from web3 into the function ContractKit.newKitFromWeb3 to define your instance.\

```javascript
const kit = ContractKit.newKitFromWeb3(web3);
```

### Private Key

The private key is required to make a connection to the network. This defines which account is being used
to read and write from the blockchain and is the account that pays transaction fees whenever you make a
transaction.

    ```javascript

const PRIVATE_KEY = "0xc010dfbc3acd55b8e25113773b363c7abe8642a58d4e4c8b3a4d586b3eab8ce8";

````

> Note: This private key is for a test network and is pre-filled with some test Celo to make it easy for you to get started. You can use your account by replacing this private key at any time.

### Account
The function [web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.7/web3-eth-accounts.html#privatekeytoaccount) allows you to create an account object from a private key. This line passes your PRIVATE_KEY to that function to set it as your account.


    ```javascript
const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(PRIVATE_KEY);
````

### Address

The address isn’t required to make your connection to Celo, but it’s used in the functions created later in
this file. This will be the receiving address of any transactions you make, and you may update this to your
address at any time.

```javascript
let address = "0x742f06f94B9F88fc263C433a19576D361a3E9D94";
```

### Value

Similar to address, value is not required to make a connection to the network. This is here to define the
value of Celo transferred between accounts later in the code.

```javascript
let value = ".01";
```

### Connect to the network

Now that you’ve defined each of your variables, you’re ready to make your connection to the network.

### Add Account

This line connects your account to the network allowing you to sign transactions with your private key.

```javascript
kit.connection.addAccount(account.privateKey);
```

### Default Account

This line defines your default account for network transactions.

```javascript
kit.defaultAccount = account.address;
```

You’re now connected to Celo and are ready to run functions using ContractKit!

---

### Step 3: Name

The name function reads the name of the Celo Native Asset.

```javascript
async function name() {
  let contract = await kit.contracts.getGoldToken();
  let name = await contract.name();
  console.log(`${name}`);
}
```

Uncomment name(); to run this function.

#### Learn more

Read the code above and use the following resources to learn more about the name(); function.

- [name](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L27)
  > Note: The name is a unique identifier for the CELO token. It was initially named Celo Gold and was later changed to its current name. If you see references to GoldToken in the code, it is because it is referring to the original name of CELO.

### Step 4: Symbol

The symbol function reads the symbol of the Celo Native Asset.

```javascript
async function symbol() {
  let contract = await kit.contracts.getGoldToken();
  let symbol = await contract.symbol();
  console.log(`${symbol}`);
}
```

Uncomment symbol(); to run this function.

#### Learn more

Read the code above and use the following resources to learn more about the symbol(); function.

- [symbol](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L27)
  > Note: The symbol is a unique identifier for the CELO token.

### Step 5: Total supply

The totalSupply function reads the total supply of the Celo Native Asset.

```javascript
async function totalSupply() {
  let contract = await kit.contracts.getGoldToken();
  let totalSupply = await contract.totalSupply();
  console.log(`${totalSupply}`);
}
```

Uncomment totalSupply(); to run this function.

#### Learn more

Read the code above and use the following resources to learn more about the totalSupply(); function.

- [totalSupply](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L29)

> Note: The total supply is the entire amount of CELO in existence. When creating the token, this number was defined and can change if the contract owner mints or burns tokens.

---

### Step 6: Decimals

The decimals function reads the number of decimals in the Celo Native Asset.

```javascript
async function decimals() {
  let contract = await kit.contracts.getGoldToken();
  let decimals = await contract.decimals();
  console.log(`${decimals}`);
}
```

Uncomment decimals(); to run this function.

#### Learn more

Read the code above and use the following resources to learn more about the decimals(); function.

- [decimals](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L28)

> Note: Having 18 decimals allows the Celo Native Asset to be broken into smaller denominations. For example, it is possible to send .000000000000000001 CELO to another user.

### Step 7: Balance of

The balanceOf function reads the balance of a given address.

```javascript
async function balanceOf() {
  let contract = await kit.contracts.getGoldToken();
  let balanceOf = await contract.balanceOf(account.address);
  console.log(`${balanceOf}`);
}
```

Uncomment balanceOf(); to run this function.

#### Learn more

Read the code above and use the following resources to learn more about the balanceOf(); function.

- [balanceOf](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L229)

> Note: Change the account variable defined at the top of this file to read the balance of a new account.

### Step 8: Transfer

The transfer function transfers CELO from one address to another. It sends a value from the account of the
PRIVATE_KEY to the given address. You can change these variables from earlier in the file if you want to
use different addresses.

```javascript
async function transfer() {
  let amount = kit.web3.utils.toWei(value, "ether");
  let contract = await kit.contracts.getGoldToken();
  let transaction = await contract
    .transfer(address, amount)
    .send({ from: account.address });
  let receipt = await transaction.waitReceipt();
  let balance = await contract.balanceOf(account.address);
  console.log(
    `Transaction: https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/tx/${receipt.transactionHash}/`,
    "\n",
    `Balance: ${kit.web3.utils.fromWei(balance.toString(), "ether")}`
  );
}
```

Uncomment transfer(); to run this function.

#### Learn more

Read the code above and use the following resources to learn more about the transfer(); function.

- [web3.utils.toWei](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-utils.html#towei)
- [transfer] (https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L71)
- [balanceOf](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L229)
- [Celo Block Explorer](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/)

> Note: The default settings use a testnet account that is available for anyone trying to learn more about Celo. The CELO in it isn’t worth anything so please leave some for other people to try!

### Step 9: Transfer with comment

The transferwithComment function works almost exactly the same as the transfer function above. The only
difference is that it allows you to include a comment when making your transaction.

```javascript
async function transferWithComment() {
  let amount = kit.web3.utils.toWei(value, "ether");
  let contract = await kit.contracts.getGoldToken();
  let transaction = await contract
    .transferWithComment(address, amount, comment)
    .send({ from: account.address });
  let receipt = await transaction.waitReceipt();
  let balance = await contract.balanceOf(account.address);
  console.log(
    `Transaction: https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/tx/${receipt.transactionHash}/`,
    "\n",
    `Balance: ${kit.web3.utils.fromWei(balance.toString(), "ether")}`
  );
}
```

Uncomment transferWithComment(); to run this function.

#### Learn more

Read the code above and use the following resources to learn more about the transferWithComment(); function.

- web3.utils.toWei
- [transferWithComment](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L82)
- balanceOf
- Celo Block Explorer

> Note: Including comments in a transaction is common in payment applications like Venmo, PayPal, and others. This function makes it possible to do the same with your Celo transactions. Before using this function, keep in mind that there is a cost to storing text on the blockchain and that anything written to it will be there forever.

### Step 10: Experiment with the code

At this point, you’ve run many of the functions available on the [GoldToken.sol](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L27) contract.
You can now try a few experiments to learn more and extend the functionality of your code.

### Extend GoldToken.sol features

First, you can try writing code to access other functions on the [GoldToken.sol](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L27) contract.
For example, the [allowance](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GoldToken.sol#L212) function allows an account to approve Celo transactions on behalf of another account.

![celo](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*B6y5Fv5UDB10I8m5nsWH_w.png)

### Connect to other Contracts

As mentioned earlier, ContractKit allows you to access any of the Celo Core Contracts that has a contract
wrapper. For example, this post focused on GoldToken.sol which is exposed to ContractKit using the
GoldTokenWrapper.

These wrappers are accessible using the format getNameOfContract();. To access another contract, you can
update the contract variable in the function, then use it to call a function that exists within the new
contract.

For example, the [StableTokenWrapper](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/sdk/contractkit/src/wrappers/StableTokenWrapper.ts)
provides access to the [StableToken.sol](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/eeff8c40bd871380af0e1b2544287599366bf2d4/packages/protocol/contracts/stability/StableToken.sol)
contract by using getStableToken();. By updating the name() function in your current code, you can instead
read the name of the Celo stable token.

```javascript
async function name() {
  let contract = await kit.contracts.getStableToken();
  let name = await contract.name();
  console.log(`${name}`);
}
```

This same idea applies to all of the contract wrappers provided by Celo. While others may take a bit more
experimenting to set up, it’s a great way to get more familiar with ContractKit and allows you to expand
the functionality of your applications.

### Connect to Mainnet

Throughout this tutorial, you have interacted with the Celo Alfajores Testnet. This same functionality is
available on Celo Mainnet by making the following change to your code.

#### Update

```javascript
const web3 = new Web3(`https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org`);
```

To…

```javascript
const web3 = new Web3(`https://forno.celo.org`);
```

This line uses Forno to connect to a hosted node on Mainnet. Keep in mind that this will result in
transactions that cost CELO which have real world value. You can learn more about Forno and its network
options [here](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/forno).
