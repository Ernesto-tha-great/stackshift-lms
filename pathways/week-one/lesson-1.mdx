### Built for mobile so you can build for all

The Celo Platform is a fully [EVM compatible](https://medium.com/celoorg/donut-hardfork-is-live-on-celo-585e2e294dcb), [proof-of-stake](https://medium.com/celoorg/celos-proof-of-stake-mechanism-31061fbebea),
[carbon-negative](https://medium.com/celoorg/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490), layer-1 protocol,
featuring a fast ultralight client and built-in seigniorage stablecoins, collateralized by crypto and
natural assets. It has an average block time of 5 seconds, an average cost of less than $.01 per
transaction, and has a carbon-negative offset averaging 65.7 tons per month.

### Phone Number Mapping

Authenticate users by mapping their phone numbers to public keys for a convenient mobile payment experience.

### Fast sync for ultralight clients

Provide secure and highly efficient blockchain syncing for quick, trustless payment verification for
users on any mobile device.

### Cross-chain interoperability

Build cross-chain applications that send transactions, assets, and messages between a growing
number of interoperable blockchains.

### Stable value currencies

Make crypto payments accessible using a family of Celo-native stablecoins with full support for
ERC-20-like tokens including cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL.

### Multi-currency gas fees

Keep crypto payments fast and simple by allowing transaction fee payments in any Celo-native stable currency.

### EVM Compatibility

Develop using popular Ethereum tools (like MetaMask, Truffle & Hardhat), code in Solidity,
and quickly deploy EVM compatible applications on Celo.

### Celo first steps

Celo’s collection of applications, tools, and resources make it simple to access wallets, manage
assets, explore the blockchain or start building advanced dApps and integrations.

### Send, receive, and save Celo assets

Choose a wallet to start managing Celo assets.

### Celo Wallet

Easily send, receive, and save Celo assets with a [Celo Wallet](https://celo.org/developers/wallet).
Install the [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/celoextensionwallet/kkilomkmpmkbdnfelcpgckmpcaemjcdh),
[wallet app](https://celowallet.app/setup),
or [developer wallet](https://celo.org/developers/wallet) to start using Celo.

### Valora

Make global peer-to-peer payments simple and accessible to anyone with Valora. Install the [Valora app](https://valoraapp.com/)
and view the [GitHub](https://github.com/valora-inc/wallet#valora-mobile-app) for more info and developer integration options.

### MetaMask

Connect Celo to any EVM-compatible application with MetaMask. Install MetaMask, configure it to work
with Celo, and import Valora (optional ) to start managing Celo assets.

### Manage your CELO, cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL

Use your wallet to send, receive, and save your Celo assets.

### Get CELO

Earn rewards, stake with validators, and vote on proposals that shape the future of Celo as a CELO holder.
Get CELO on any of these [20+ exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celo/markets/) worldwide.

### Use Celo Stablecoins

Make use of Celo Dollars (cUSD), Celo Euro (cEUR), and Celo Real (cREAL) stablecoins which algorithmically
follow their currency and are backed by the Celo Reserve.

### Get Test Funds

Get testnet funds by switching your Celo Wallet or MetaMask Wallet to the Alfajores testnet.
Send your wallet funds for testing or development using the [Alfajores testnet faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet).

### Explore on-chain Celo network data

View live data on any network on a website or with the command-line interface.

### View statistics

Access information about the Celo blockchain including average block time, total transactions,
and additional transaction details using [blockscout](https://explorer.celo.org/) or [stats.celo.org](https://stats.celo.org/).

### Install the CLI

Interact with the Celo Protocol smart contracts using the Celo command-line interface (CLI).
Install using npm and view the CLI docs to learn more.

### Build fast, sustainable, mobile dApps

Celo allows you to develop using popular Ethereum tools like MetaMask, Truffle, Hardhat, and more.
Code using the Solidity programming language for fast development and secure smart contracts. Deploy
dApps using Celo’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible infrastructure.

![celo](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*O-pmqlWF99JPrYJL-wrPNQ.png)

### Set up your Environment

Install dependencies including Celo CLI, Node.js, Xcode, and Android Studio on [Mac](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/using-mac)/[Windows](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/start/develop-on-windows) or get started fast using the [Remix IDE](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/deploy-remix).

### Build a dApp

Deploy a dApp on Celo using [Remix](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/deploy-remix), [Truffle](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/deploy-truffle), Hardhat, or Replit.
Explore developer tutorials on Figment, Dacade, or in the [developer docs](https://docs.celo.org/blog).

### Accelerate your development

Expand your toolkit with [Celo composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-progressive-dapp-starter),
[ContractKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit), [use-contractkit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/use-contractkit),
[DAppKit](https://docs.celo.org/learn/walletconnect), [ethers.js wrapper](https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/ethers-js-wrapper),
[ganache-cli](https://github.com/celo-org/ganache-cli) and a growing collection of Celo tools built on the [Celo GitHub](https://github.com/celo-org).

### Host, run, and connect to Celo nodes

Celo has 3 networks; [Mainnet](https://explorer.celo.org/), [Alfajores Testnet (for developers)](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/), and [Baklava Testnet](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/). You have the option
to host, run, or connect to full nodes to on any network to support your needs.

![celo](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*Sg6IgJw-qy9RJHPaThlOJQ.png)

### Connect to hosted nodes

Get started fast with a hosted node service. Connect to [Forno](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/forno) or [Figment Datahub](https://www.figment.io/datahub/celo) for quick development
or [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/celo) for enterprise-grade node services.

### Run a local or remote node

Use a Docker image to run a local [Mainnet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/mainnet/running-a-full-node-in-mainnet),
[Alfajores](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet/running-a-full-node-in-alfajores), or
[Baklava](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet/running-a-full-node-in-baklava) node or
[ganache-cli](https://github.com/celo-org/ganache-cli) to run a test node.
Alternatively, run a remote node on [AWS](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/hosted-nodes#amazon-web-services) or [Google Cloud Platform](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/hosted-nodes#google-cloud-platform).

### Run a network validator

Secure the network by participating in Celo’s proof-of-stake protocol running a [Mainnet Validator](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/mainnet/running-a-validator-in-mainnet) or
[Baklava Testnet Validator](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet/running-a-validator-in-baklava) node.
