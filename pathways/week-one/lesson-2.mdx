## Getting Started | Celo CLI

The Celo Command-Line Interface (CLI) allows you to interact with the Celo Protocol and smart contracts
using command-line tools. It provides a set of modules for interacting with
Celo [ContractKit](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/master/packages/sdk/contractkit)
and is an excellent code reference when defining your own modules.

![ContractKit](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*9Te4Tzfcx5FTX0Wn7HKKWw.png)

Some common features you may want to consider are helping users participate in elections or in
on-chain governance, voting for validators, or helping users interact with multi-sig contracts.

### CLI Modules

The Celo CLI has a growing collection of modules you can use to interact with the Celo Platform.
This post will go through each of these modules in detail and provide references you can use to learn more.

### Prerequisites

Before installing the CLI, youâ€™ll need to install its dependencies.

#### Dependencies

Celo is currently deploying the CLI with Node.js v16.x. If you are running a different version of Node.js,
consider using NVM to manage your node versions.

#### Check node version

```bash
node --version
```

### Install Node Version Manager (NVM)

If you have the wrong version of node or donâ€™t have node, install the Node Version Manager (NVM) to help
manage your node versions.

#### curl

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

or ...

#### wget

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

### Verify NVM Installation

You can check that NVM is properly installed using the following command.

```bash
nvm -v
```

### Install Node.js using NVM

Install and use the correct version of node with the following command.

```bash
nvm install 12 && nvm use 12
```

---

### Install the CLI

Install the Celo CLI with npm using the following command.

```bash
npm install -g @celo/celocli
```

![cli](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*YCKIe5lEpl5C7tIZzxvmrQ.png)

---

### CLI Configuration

You can configure the CLI to work with Celo Mainnet, Alfajores Testnet, or Baklava Testnet
using the following commands.

### Celo Mainnet

```bash
celocli config:set --node=https://forno.celo.org
```

### Alfajores Testnet

```bash
celocli config:set --node=https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org
```

### Baklava Testnet

```bash
celocli config:set --node=https://baklava-forno.celo-testnet.org
```

### Verify CLI configuration

Verify your network configuration using the following command. The image below shows configuration with
the Alfajores Testnet.

```bash
celocli config:get
```

![cli](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*h7Tln3zkg5G_HRdN9hBBqQ.png)

---

### Help Command

The Help command allows you to display additional details for any CLI command. This post provides the
help command for every command so that you can easily run them from your terminal to learn more.

```bash
celocli --help

```

![cli](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*DlzIsX02Kgra2yFrhm0b2A.png)

---

Youâ€™re ready to start reading from the Celo blockchain!

---

### Example: Find account balance

Before going through each of the CLI commands, follow this example to read an account balance from the Alfajores Testnet.

### Set configuration to Alfajores Testnet

```bash
celocli config:set --node=https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org

```

### View account help details

View the account help details and look for account:balance. Youâ€™ll use this command to view the
balance of your account.

```bash
celocli account --help

```

![cli](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*ahLDog4GG4b43zIS54JNKg.png)

### View account:balance details

You can read additional details for account:balance (and any sub-command) by including that command in
your help command.

```bash
celocli account:balance --help

```

![cli](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*C7QyW2bCEaA0WB7ljCWiXA.png)

This command with show you the usage, options, and examples for this command. By using these options and
replacing the examples with your own values, you can return your own values from the Celo blockchain.

```bash
celocli account:balance --help

```

### View account balance

Choose any Alfajores Testnet account balance to view from the terminal. If you donâ€™t have an account,
you can use the one provided here.

```bash
celocli account:balance 0xd55e4A1412E28BcFA56e8Acf6F9F2E65Ce4c9923

```

![cli](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*J6y1ETi8Mh7GHdV05x6jhw.png)

If you made it this far you have installed the CLI and read your first account balance! Youâ€™re now ready to read the docs and code to explore any command on the Celo CLI.

For any command you find interesting, run it in your terminal, explore the docs, and click See code
to get a better understanding of how each CLI command works. Once you get the hang of it, you wonâ€™t need
this post, the docs, or the code. Everything you need is available from the terminal for you to explore
however youâ€™d like!
