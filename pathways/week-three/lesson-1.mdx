## Retire Carbon Credits

Carbon credits have emerged as a popular way to mitigate the impact of climate change caused by the release of
greenhouse gases. A carbon credit is a permit that allows a company or organization to emit a certain amount of
carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As the world moves towards reducing carbon
emissions, carbon credits have become an essential tool for companies to offset their carbon emissions.

With the rise of carbon credits, it's not surprising that we're now seeing a new use case for NFTs: retiring
carbon credits. Carbon credits can be retired by transferring ownership to a non-operational entity, essentially
removing the credit from the market and preventing it from being used by another party to offset their
emissions. This process is called carbon credit retirement.

Traditionally, carbon credit retirement has been done through a cumbersome process of paperwork and manual
tracking, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. With the advent of NFTs, carbon credit retirement can
now be done in a much simpler and efficient manner.

An NFT can be created to represent ownership of a carbon credit, and when it is retired, the NFT can be burned.

There are several benefits to using NFTs for carbon credit retirement. First, NFTs provide a unique and
tamper-proof way of tracking the ownership of carbon credits. This ensures that the credits are retired properly
and cannot be used by another party.

Second, NFTs can be easily transferred between parties, making it easy to retire credits from multiple sources.
This can help to streamline the carbon credit retirement process, reducing paperwork and time spent on manual
tracking.

Third, the use of NFTs can help to increase transparency and accountability in the carbon credit market.
The public nature of blockchain technology means that the retirement of carbon credits can be easily tracked
and verified, providing greater trust and confidence in the carbon credit market.

The Retire Carbon Credits smart contract is a Solidity contract that extends the ERC721 standard to create
non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for carbon credits. It allows users to mint new carbon credits, and then retire
them when they have been used to offset carbon emissions.

The contract includes the following features:

- Minting of carbon credits with associated project data
- Burning of carbon credits when they have been retired
- Retrieval of project and retire data associated with a particular token ID
- Pausable function to stop the token transfer during emergencies

The contract also incorporates the ERC2981 standard, which allows for the implementation of a royalty payment
scheme, where a percentage of each transaction can be directed to a designated royalty recipient.

### Usage

To deploy the contract, simply compile it in a Solidity compiler like Remix and deploy it to the Ethereum
network. The contract's constructor function sets the default royalty percentage and the royalty recipient's
address.

To mint a new carbon credit, call the `safeMint` function and pass in the recipient's address, the URI for the
token's metadata, and the project data associated with the token.

To retire a carbon credit, call the `burnToken` function and pass in the token ID, the retire message and the
amount of tokens to retire.

The `getProjectData` and `getRetireData` functions can be used to retrieve the project and retire data
associated with a particular token ID.

### Code

Let's break down the code and understand the different components of the contract:

```solidity
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/common/ERC2981.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/Pausable.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Burnable.sol";
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
```

These are import statements for various OpenZeppelin libraries used in the contract. These libraries provide
commonly used functionality for developing smart contracts and have been audited by the community.

```solidity

    contract RetireCarbonCredits is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, ERC721URIStorage, ERC2981, Pausable, Ownable, ERC721Burnable
```

This is the declaration of the contract named `RetireCarbonCredits`. The contract inherits from several OpenZeppelin contracts, including ERC721 (for implementing the NFT standard), ERC721Enumerable (for enabling iteration over NFTs), ERC721URIStorage (for storing NFT metadata), ERC2981 (for royalty payments), Pausable (for emergency stop functionality), Ownable (for access control), and ERC721Burnable (for burning NFTs).

```solidity
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIdCounter;
```

This is a counter variable that is used to assign unique token IDs to newly minted NFTs.

```solidity
    uint96 public royaltypercentage;
    address public royaltyaddress;
```

These are public variables that store the royalty percentage and the address of the account that should
receive the royalty payment when the NFT is sold.

```solidity
    string private url;

```

This is a private variable that stores the base URI for the NFT metadata.

```solidity
    struct ProjectData {
        string name;
        uint256 projectTokenId;
        string methodology;
        string region;
        string emissionType;
        string uri;
        address creator;
    }
```

This is a struct that defines the properties of a carbon credit project that the NFT represents. It includes
the project name, token ID, methodology, region, emission type, URI, and the address of the creator.

```solidity
    struct RetireData{
    uint256 retireTokenId;
    address beneceficiary;
    string retireMessage;
    uint256 timeStamp;
    uint256 amount;
    }
```

A struct that contains information related to the retirement of the NFT, including the ID of the NFT being
retired (`retireTokenId`), the address of the beneficiary (`beneceficiary`), a message to explain the
retirement (`retireMessage`), the timestamp of the retirement (`timeStamp`), and the amount of the retirement
(`amount`).

```solidity
    mapping (uint256 => ProjectData) private _projectData;
    mapping (uint256 => RetireData) private _retireData;
```

- `_projectData`: A private mapping that maps a token ID to a `ProjectData` struct. This is used to store information related to the project associated with the NFT.
- `_retireData`: A private mapping that maps a token ID to a `RetireData` struct. This is used to store information related to the retirement of the NFT.

```solidity
  constructor() ERC721("Retire Carbon Credits", "RCC") { royaltypercentage = 150; royaltyaddress = 0xE3506A38C80D8bA1ef219ADF55E31E18FB88EbF4; \_setDefaultRoyalty(royaltyaddress ,royaltypercentage ); }
```

The constructor function initializes the contract and sets the name and symbol of the token to "Retire Carbon Credits" and "RCC", respectively. It also sets the royalty percentage to 150 and the address of the royalty recipient to 0xE3506A38C80D8bA1ef219ADF55E31E18FB88EbF4. Lastly, it calls `_setDefaultRoyalty`, which is not shown in this code snippet, but likely sets up a royalty mechanism for the NFT.

Let's break down the functions in the contract and their purposes:

1.  `_baseURI`: This is an internal function that returns the base URI for the NFT metadata.
2.  `pause`: This function pauses the contract and can only be called by the contract owner.
3.  `unpause`: This function unpauses the contract and can only be called by the contract owner.
4.  `safeMint`: This function creates a new NFT and assigns ownership to the specified address. It also sets the token URI and stores project data associated with the token.
5.  `_beforeTokenTransfer`: This is an internal function that is called before a token transfer occurs. It ensures that the contract is not paused and calls the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function in the ERC721 and ERC721Enumerable contracts.
6.  `_burn`: This is an internal function that burns an existing token.
7.  `burnToken`: This function burns an existing token and stores retire data associated with the token.
8.  `ownerOf`: This function returns the owner of a given token ID.
9.  `tokenURI`: This function returns the token URI for a given token ID.
10. `supportsInterface`: This function checks whether a given interface is supported by the contract and calls the `supportsInterface` function in the ERC721, ERC2981, and ERC721Enumerable contracts.

11. `getProjectData`: This function returns the project data associated with a given token ID.

12. `getRetireData`: This function returns the retire data associated with a given token ID.

### Deploy - Smart Contract

Before deploying the contract, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Obtain a CeloExtensionWallet. You can download the CeloExtensionWallet from the Google Chrome store.

2. After downloading the wallet, create a new wallet and securely save the key phrase.

3. Fund your wallet using the Celo Faucet. To do this, copy the wallet address and visit the [Celo Faucet](https://faucet.celo.org/) . Paste your wallet address into the designated field and confirm.

4. To use Remix for deployment, download and enable the Celo Remix Plugin from the plugin manager. Then, connect your CeloExtensionWallet to Remix and deploy your contract.

### Frontend

To set up your React dapp, you will need to create a new React project. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```javascript

npx create-react-app retirecarbon

```

This process may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

2. Navigate to the directory that was created.

3. Open the directory using your preferred code editor, such as VSCode. In the terminal, run the following command:

```javascript
code retirecarbon
```

This will open a new VSCode window with the "retirecarbon" directory.

4. Next, in the "package.json" file, replace the existing code with the following:

```javascript
{
  "name": "retirecarbon",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@celo/contractkit": "^1.2.4",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.4",
    "@testing-library/react": "^11.1.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.1.10",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-error-overlay": "^6.0.9",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.3.0",
    "react-scripts": "^2.1.3",
    "web-vitals": "^1.0.1",
    "web3": "^1.3.6"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-app-rewired": "^2.2.1"
  }
}
```

This will ensure that all the necessary dependencies for building the frontend are in place.

5. The @celo/contractkit is a library designed to make it easy for developers to interact with the Celo blockchain network by providing a simple and intuitive way to interact with smart contracts on the Celo network.

Celo is an open-source blockchain platform that aims to make financial tools accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. It is designed to be a fast and scalable platform for building decentralized applications (dApps) and is particularly well-suited for developing mobile-based dApps.

The @celo/contractkit library is built on top of the Web3.js library and provides several additional features that make it easier to work with the Celo network.

6. Finally, install all dependencies by running the command:

```bash
npm install
```

7. Once installation is complete, start the server with the command:

```bash
npm start
```

8. HTML

To begin building the foundation of your decentralized application (DApp) using HTML, you'll need to complete the following step in this tutorial.

Firstly, add a new folder named "assets" to the "public" folder. This folder contains CSS properties and images that will be utilized to facilitate the speedy development of your DApp.

Next, open the "index.html" file located in the "public" folder of your project and let's get started.

```html

```

### JS frontend

To create the frontend for your React DApp, you can create several JS files that will each handle a specific part of the UI. Here are a few examples:

- "addNFT.js": This file can handle the logic for adding a new NFT (non-fungible token) to your collection. It could contain a form with fields for the name, description, and image of the NFT. When the user submits the form, this file could call a function from your smart contract to add the NFT to the blockchain.

- "Banner.js": This file can create a banner that will be displayed at the top of your app. You could use this to show information about your project, such as its name or logo. It could also contain links to other parts of your app, such as the addNFT form.

- "Header.js": This file can create a header that will be displayed on every page of your app. You could use this to show navigation links, such as a link to the home page or a link to the user's NFT collection.

- "RetireNFT.js": This file can handle the logic for retiring an NFT from your collection. When the user clicks the button, this file could call a function from your smart contract to burn the NFT from the blockchain.

By breaking up your UI into smaller components like this, you can make your code more modular and easier to maintain. You can also reuse these components across different parts of your app, which can save you time and effort.

### App.js

The starting point for the React frontend of the application is the App.js file. The App component is responsible for organizing and laying out all other components. This file begins with the importation of necessary libraries, components, and hooks.

To start, import standard React hooks such as useState from the React library. Next, import the web3 and contractkit from their respective libraries.

After deploying your contract on Remix, you'll find the address you need to interact with the functionality in your smart contract. Assign this contract address to a variable named contractAddress.

### ABI

Create an "abis" folder within the "src" folder. This folder will contain the file "nft.abi.json".

To interact with a smart contract that is deployed in bytecode, you'll need an interface called the Application Binary Interface (ABI) for the ContractKit to interpret the bytecode. The ABI enables the execution of functions and the reading of data. When compiling a contract using Remix, the ABI is generated as a JSON file.
